									The Arches Project has been founded with the aim to actively support and encourage the natural creative talents within the UK. This is a great platform for talented creative people with a passion for the arts to gain experience within the industry.
									We have showcased Romeo and Juliet, Hamlet by Shakespeare, open mic music sessions and comedy shows, celebration dinners, interactive & visual design and fine art exhibitions, showing work of established and emerging artists in this exciting and unique space in the heart of Birmingham. We are pleased that artists that have been using our services have now found full time employment.
